# Agent Teams

English | [中文](agent-team.zh.md)

Types shared by the experimental implicit-root Team domain, model tools, and host adapters. The [Agent Teams Agent Note](../../.agents/notes/implemented/feature/2026-08-05-agent-teams.md) owns identity, mailbox, task, and shared-checkout decisions; this page records the durable and client-visible forms from [`packages/experimental/agent-team/src/types.ts`](../../packages/experimental/agent-team/src/types.ts).

## Identity and roster

`TeamId` is the root `SessionId` under a distinct [brand](core.md#branded-ids). `TeamTaskId` is Team-local and monotonically allocated as `task-<n>`; `TeamMessageId` is globally random. A teammate's Session id remains its persistent identity, while `name` is an immutable model/UI label.

```ts type-equiv
/** Whole durable value written on every teammate lifecycle change. */
interface TeamMemberSnapshot {
  readonly id: SessionId
  readonly name: string
  readonly description: string
  readonly provider: string
  readonly context: 'fresh' | 'fork'
  /** Explicit composition captured for creation and cold recovery; omission inherits the Lead preset. */
  readonly preset?: TeamPresetBinding
  readonly phase: TeamMemberPhase
  readonly error?: string
}
```

Every member starts in `provisioning` and reaches `active` or `failed`. The Lead can move an active or failed member through `retiring` to `retired` after settling assignments and mail; the Session and immutable name remain. A configured member retains its Preset id and declaration revision across creation and cold continuation. Roster `running`/`inactive` status is derived separately and never rewrites this record.

## Durable mailbox

The Lead Session first stores the complete queued message. A target receipt is acknowledged only after its pending inbox item or recorded user message is durable. The Lead can cancel undelivered messages with a reason before retiring an unavailable member. The recovery mailbox is queued-minus-delivered-minus-cancelled.

```ts type-equiv
/** One peer message retained until its target Session records it. */
interface TeamMessageSnapshot {
  readonly id: TeamMessageId
  readonly senderId: SessionId
  readonly senderName: string
  readonly targetId: SessionId
  readonly content: ContentBlock[]
}
```

```ts type-equiv
/** Lead-authorized cancellation of one undelivered Team message. */
interface TeamMessageCancellation {
  readonly messageId: TeamMessageId
  readonly targetId: SessionId
  readonly reason: string
}
```

Every message attempts Steer delivery. A running target receives it at the nearest step boundary; an inactive target starts a turn if loaded or cold-resumes otherwise. Scheduling is not stored in the durable record because callers cannot select another mode.

The target Session keeps message identity and sender attribution on both the pending inbox item and the eventual user message. Folding that source across inbox and history is the target-side de-duplication key; the model-visible framing repeats the id and sender.

```ts type-equiv
/** Source retained by the target Session for durable mailbox de-duplication. */
interface TeamMessageSource {
  readonly kind: 'team-message'
  readonly teamId: TeamId
  readonly messageId: TeamMessageId
  readonly senderId: SessionId
  readonly senderName: string
}
```

## Shared task DAG

Every task event stores a complete snapshot. `revision` is the compare-and-set value and increments by one per mutation. `blockedBy` edges must name non-deleted tasks and keep the graph acyclic. `writeScopes` are normalized advisory path prefixes rather than locks.

```ts type-equiv
/** Whole durable task snapshot; every mutation increments {@link revision}. */
interface TeamTaskSnapshot {
  readonly id: TeamTaskId
  readonly revision: number
  readonly subject: string
  readonly description: string
  readonly status: TeamTaskStatus
  readonly ownerId?: SessionId
  readonly blockedBy: TeamTaskId[]
  readonly writeScopes: string[]
}
```

`pending` is unstarted or released, `in_progress` carries an owner, `completed` satisfies blockers, and `deleted` is a retained tombstone. Views add owner name, readiness, and write-scope overlap warnings without changing the durable snapshot.

An optional Host writer can submit several native Task snapshots and mailbox notices in one `team/task/transaction` event. The registered writer receives a detached Board snapshot under the Team transaction lock; each existing Task must match its previous revision, and newly allocated numeric ids are sequential. The native projection validates the final DAG and folds Task values plus notices. The extension owns the JSON string in the same event and may register a separate projection for its review details; it cannot replace the native Board.

```ts type-equiv
/** One new or next-revision Task written by an optional Team extension. */
interface TeamTaskTransactionUpdate {
  /** Null creates a new Task; otherwise the current revision must match. */
  readonly previousRevision: number | null
  readonly task: TeamTaskSnapshot
}
```

```ts type-equiv
/** Detached native Team state available to one synchronous extension planner. */
interface TeamTaskTransactionSnapshot {
  readonly tasks: readonly TeamTaskSnapshot[]
  readonly members: readonly TeamMemberSnapshot[]
  readonly nextTaskNumber: number
}
```

```ts type-equiv
/** Atomic native Task updates with opaque extension-owned JSON. */
interface TeamTaskTransactionPlan {
  readonly updates: readonly TeamTaskTransactionUpdate[]
  readonly dataJson: string
  /** Durable Team messages enqueued atomically with the Task updates. */
  readonly notices?: readonly TeamMessageSnapshot[]
}
```

## Web projection

The Lead Session publishes `SessionProjectionMap.agentTeam` with durable roster rows and non-deleted task views. `failure` reports a rejected persisted record beside the last valid state. Member activity comes from Session status; model labels come from each member's `modelSelection` projection.

```ts type-equiv
/** One durable roster row published through the `agentTeam` Session projection. */
interface TeamMemberProjection {
  readonly id: SessionId
  readonly name: string
  readonly role: 'lead' | 'teammate'
  /** Durable lifecycle; the Lead row is always `active`. Turn activity comes from Session status. */
  readonly phase: TeamMemberPhase
  readonly preset?: TeamPresetBinding
  readonly error?: string
}
```

```ts type-equiv
/** Runtime-enriched task view returned to tools and hosts. */
interface TeamTaskView {
  readonly id: TeamTaskId
  readonly revision: number
  readonly subject: string
  readonly description: string
  readonly status: TeamTaskStatus
  readonly blockedBy: TeamTaskId[]
  readonly writeScopes: string[]
  readonly ownerName?: string
  readonly ready: boolean
  readonly writeScopeWarnings: string[]
}
```

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * Durable Team state published to browser clients through the Lead Session's
 * `agentTeam` projection. `failure` names the first rejected persisted Team
 * record; members and tasks then stay at the last valid state.
 */
interface TeamProjection {
  readonly members: TeamMemberProjection[]
  readonly tasks: TeamTaskView[]
  readonly failure?: string
}
```

## Replay

The `agentTeam` Session projection replays one root Session into the roster, task board, and queued-minus-delivered mailbox that every Team operation reads. It selects records by `TeamId`, so events inherited by an ordinary fork retain the ancestor id and never enter the new root's state. Session event `seq` and `time` remain the ordering and timing record; Team snapshots do not duplicate them. Roster and task reads reach callers as views; pending mail stays internal to delivery and recovery. The package [README](../../packages/experimental/agent-team/README.md) owns operation, authorization, recovery, and limit behavior.

## Cordis API

Generated from source by `scripts/gen-cordis-catalog.ts` (verified fresh by `pnpm run verify-cordis-catalog` in doc-sync; regenerate with `pnpm run gen-cordis-catalog`) — the language sides differ only in locale-specific paired document paths. Signature blocks use a `ts cordis-catalog` fence and keep the original source JSDoc; dispatch modes are defined in the [primer](../cordis-primer.md#dispatch-modes), and the framework-inherited `ctx` API lives in [cordis-api/inherited.md](../cordis-api/inherited.md).
